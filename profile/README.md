# LLabs Tech

**Swift-first tooling ‚Ä¢ on-device & edge AI ‚Ä¢ pragmatic DevOps**

We open-source the things we need every day: lightweight Swift services, self-hosted LLM wrappers, game-dev utilities, AI-powered engineering agents, and home-lab recipes that help indie developers run modern apps and ML workloads on their own hardware.

## üß∞ What we build

| Domain | Current Focus |
| ------ | ------------- |
| **Server-Side Swift** | ‚Ä¢ Micro-services with Vapor & Hummingbird (e.g. üå®Ô∏è *SnowCover API* powered by Sentinel data)<br>‚Ä¢ **SRM** ‚Äì a Swift replacement for pm2 with auto-restart & startup helpers |
| **Local & Edge AI** | ‚Ä¢ Jetson-ready fork of **llama.cpp** (CUDA 10.2)<br>‚Ä¢ **SwiftLlama** ‚Äì idiomatic Swift wrapper for llama.cpp<br>‚Ä¢ **Trae Swift Agent** ‚Äì type-safe Swift port of Bytedance‚Äôs Trae Agent for AI-driven software-engineering automation |
| **Mobile & Cross-Platform** | ‚Ä¢ iOS sports-tracking, map solutions, all kinds of navigation & AR prototypes<br>‚Ä¢ VR prototypes with SwiftGodot on Apple Vision / Meta Quest<br>‚Ä¢ React-Native + Python back-ends for LLM micro-services |
| **Game Tech** | ‚Ä¢ Godot 4 + SwiftGodot R&D for 2D RPG/strategy games & terrain generation<br>‚Ä¢ Unique *Unity as a Framework* integration to embed Unity into any iOS view<br>‚Ä¢ Home-IoT experiments, including hardware setup and selection |
| **Home-Lab / Dev-Ops** | ‚Ä¢ Raspberry Pi / Jetson clusters for distributed LLM inference<br>‚Ä¢ NGINX, Docker, systemd & PM2 playbooks<br>‚Ä¢ Automated deployment scripts and Telegram bot monitors |
